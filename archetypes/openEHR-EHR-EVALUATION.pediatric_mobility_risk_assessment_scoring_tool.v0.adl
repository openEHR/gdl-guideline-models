			use = <"The Pediatric Mobility Risk-Assessment Scoring consist of five indicators: complexity of airway anatomy, stoma or skin healing concerns, physiologic stability, patient’s cognitive status, and patient’s ability to participate in rehabilitation. Risk-assessment performed by calculating sub score of each indicator ranging from 0 to 2 in daily basis. Higher evaluation score signifying clinical issues for the patient. A total score 0 to 1 indicate early Edge of Bed (EOB) and Out of Bed (OOB) mobility is recommended prior to first tracheostomy replacement. Score 3 to 4 require further clinical evaluation for the risks associated with EOB and OOB due to patient movements. Total score of 5 and above suggest that EOB and OOB mobilization is contraindicated.">

Therefore, individualized postoperative care should be implemented. Mobilization protocols following surgical procedures promote optimal patient outcomes in the sense of skeletal muscle and cardiopulmonary functions.
