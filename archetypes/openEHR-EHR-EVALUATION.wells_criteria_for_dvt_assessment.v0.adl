The Wells’ DVT criteria can be used in outpatient as well as emergency department settings and should be applied after a thorough history and physical examination, resulting in a suspicion of DVT.

A low risk score (<2) along with a negative test result for d-dimer excludes the need for further examination with ultrasound. 

The score is generated based on seven weighted criteria:

- active cancer
- paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilisation of the legs
- bedridden recently ≥3 days or major surgery within 12 weeks
- localized tenderness along the deep venous system
- entire leg swollen
- calf swelling >3 cm compared to the other leg
- pitting oedema 
- collateral (nonvaricose) superficial veins
- alternative diagnosis to DVT at least as likely

The maximum score is 8p and a score of 2p or more suggests high probability of DVT.  (en)">
