					description = <"The Genetically Inspired Prognostic Scoring System (GIPPS) is a prognostic tool that relies exclusively on genetic markers to assess disease risk. It is designed for primary myelofibrosis (PMF), an aggressive myeloid malignancy with a median survival of approximately six years. Currently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) remains the only potentially curative treatment for PMF. However, alloSCT carries significant risks of treatment-related morbidity and mortality, making personalized risk-benefit assessment essential before proceeding. GIPPS supports clinical decision-making by identifying patients in whom the potential benefits of alloSCT may outweigh the risks, thereby guiding more individualized and informed treatment strategies.">
