It may be incorporated into routine geriatric assessments, particularly in primary care, outpatient psychiatric clinics, inpatient settings, and long-term care facilities. The tool can be either self-administered or completed with the assistance of a practitioner. In addition to screening, the GDS-15 can be useful for monitoring depressive symptoms and evaluating the effectiveness of treatment over time.">
