This classification helps guide treatment plans, monitor disease progression, and evaluate treatment outcomes.">

			use = <"Used in patients diagnosed with heart failure to evaluate their functional status and severity of symptoms. It is applicable to both chronic and acute heart failure cases.
Usage: The NYHA classification is performed by evaluating the patient's reported symptoms and exercise tolerance. The classification is divided into four classes:

Class I: No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms.

Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitations, or shortness of breath.

Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary physical activity causes symptoms.

Class IV: Inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms may be present even at rest.

The classification helps physicians determine the severity of the patient's heart failure and tailor interventions accordingly.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used as a heart failure diagnostic tool or for assessment of non-cardiac conditions. The NYHA classification is specific to heart failure and should not be applied to assess other cardiovascular diseases or non-cardiac conditions.

Not to be used as a diagnostic tool. It is used for functional classification and symptom assessment in known heart failure patients, not for diagnosing heart failure itself.
