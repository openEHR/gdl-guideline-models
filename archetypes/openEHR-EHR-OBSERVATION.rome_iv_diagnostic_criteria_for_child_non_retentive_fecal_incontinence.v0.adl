Prior iterations of the Rome criteria were based mostly on consensus, as research in child/adolescent DGBI was still largely lacking. The diagnosis of nonretentive fecal incontinence should be made by clinical history, positive symptom criteria, physical examination, and minimal diagnostic testing as clinically indicated.">
