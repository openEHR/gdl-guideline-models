It provides an estimate of survival time and likelihood of the patient requiring home assistance.">
				use = <"Each score is associated with a level of functional ability and evaluation of the patient's functional disability/ability:

0 - dead
10 - 40: - Unable to care for self; requires equivalent of institutional or hospital care; disease may be progressing rapidly.
50 - 70: - Unable to work; able to live at home and care for most personal needs; varying amount of assistance needed.
80-100: - Able to carry on normal activity and to work; no special care needed.

The scores correlate with the % survival.">
