It provides an estimate of survival time and likelihood of the patient requiring home assistance.">
				use = <"The Karnofsky performance status scale helps to give an estimate of survival time and likelihood of the patient requiring home assistance.
The scale ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 is a normal functional capcity and 0 is dead.

The tool asks a series of 10 questions each with a score of 10. Each score is associated with a level of functional ability and evaluation of the patient's functional disability/ability:

0 - dead
10 - 40: - Unable to care for self; requires equivalent of institutional or hospital care; disease may be progressing rapidly.
50 - 70: - Unable to work; able to live at home and care for most personal needs; varying amount of assistance needed.
80-100: - Able to carry on normal activity and to work; no special care needed.

The scores correlate with the % survival.
