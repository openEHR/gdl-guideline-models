				use = <"This score also included patients with left bundle branch block, which was thought to be a STEMI equivalent.

Age was divided into 2 groups, with 2 points for ages ranging from 65 to 74 years and 3 points for ages
that were >75 years.  All those below 65yrs were scored = 0

3 Historical variables were scored overall as = 1 if any of them were present (diabetes, history of angina, and history of hypertension). 
The other variables that scored 1 were a presence of anterior ST elevation or LBBB (Left bundle branch block), a time to treatment that was greater than 4hrs and a weight below 67Kg

If the patient's heart rate was > 100bpm or their Killip classification was between II and IV, they scored 2 for each of those variables

A systolic BP of < 100mmHg was scored 3 points.

Score ranges from 0 to a total score of 14 but anything above 8 would be considered of high risk.">
