In certain populations, like elite athletes and body-builders, an elevated BMI does not directly correlate to their health status due to their increased muscle mass and weight falsely increasing their BMI.","purpose":"To categorize individual's BMI based on WHO classification.","misuse":"Do not use for BMI classification of children and adolescents."}},"other_details":{"references":"1.
