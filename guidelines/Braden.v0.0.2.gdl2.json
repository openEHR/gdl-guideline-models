The score is calculated based on six different areas: activity, moisture, mobility, nutrition, sensory perception, and friction and shear. 5 input fields- activity, moisture, mobility, nutrition and sensory perception- have 4 grades with +1 denoting worst outcome and +4 denoting best outcome. The input field, friction and shear, has 3 grades with +1 denoting worst outcome and +3 denoting best outcome. These six areas form the input fields. Fill in all the input fields to calculate the total score and derive its interpretation.\n\nThe interpretation of the total score, given as risk for developing pressure ulcers, is as follows:\n\n&lt;= 12 High risk\n\n&gt;= 13 &lt;= 15 Moderate risk\n\n&gt;= 16 &lt;= 17 Mild risk\n\n&gt;= 18 Average risk","misuse":"The score should not be used by itself, but should be used in conjunction with clinical assessment as it does not capture all risk factors of developing pressure ulcers. The score should not be calculated only once, periodic assessments are necessary."}},"other_details":{"references":"Bergstrom N, Braden BJ, Laguzza A, Holman V.
