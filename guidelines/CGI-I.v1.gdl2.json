        "purpose": "The CGI scores are actually a pair of one-item measures that evaluate the (a) severity of psychopathology from 1 to 7 and (b) any improvements of treatment also on a 7 point scale (CGI-I) - (which is this scale)\n\nAs a quick assessment before a more indepth clinical assessment, the CGI scores can be filled in in under a minute by a clinician/expert rater and is easy to understand and use. It has longitudinal sensitivity over time and compares well with other more complex/time-consuming tools.",

        ],
        "use": "The CGI-I can be used at each occasion after medication has been started so that the clinician can compare the patient's condtion with the week prior. Using the CGI-S score as a base-value often assists in this comparison.\n\nThe CGI-I poses the following question: \\\"Compared to the patient’s\ncondition at admission to the project [prior to medication initiation], this patient’s condition is one of the following: \n\n1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment\n2=much improved\n3=minimally improved\n4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment)\n5=minimally worse \n6= much worse \n7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.",
        "misuse": "The guidelines outlined for the CGI scoring should be used as suggestions but not as absolutes of assessment or guidance for scoring and any other more accurate tools or reasons for deviating from the scores derived here should be taken into account as well.",
