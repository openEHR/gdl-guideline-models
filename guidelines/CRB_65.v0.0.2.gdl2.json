Consider home treatment. 30-day mortality: 1.2 %.\n\n1-2 points, moderate risk group. Consider hospital admission. 30-day mortality: 8.2 %.\n\n3-4 points, severe risk group. Urgent hospital admission. 30-day mortality: 31.3 %.\n\nCRB-65 score is fast to compute, requires likely already-available patient information, and provides an excellent risk stratification of community acquired pneumonia. It can facilitate better utilization of resources and treatment initiation especially in emergency care settings.","misuse":"The CRB-65 score includes points for confusion, which in the acutely ill elderly patient, could be due to a variety of factors and therefore should be considered with caution while assigning scores. The score does not consider comorbid factors that may affect the mortality due to community-acquired pneumonia. It should be used with caution in community setting as most validation studies are hospital based. Study results show accurate performance in hospital settings and suggest a possible over-prediction in community settings."}},"other_details":{"references":"McNally M, Curtain J, O'Brien K, Dimitrov B, Fahey T.
