","use":"CURB-65 is an acronym for Confusion, blood Urea nitrogen level, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure and age (over or equal to) 65. These form the input fields and when present, each factor contributes one (1) additional point to the total score.\n\nTotal score ranges from 0-5 and is associated with a risk level, which is in turn associated with certain care level recommendations and a 30-days mortality prediction, as follows:\n\n0-1 points, low risk group. Consider home treatment. 30-day mortality: &lt;3 %.\n\n2 points, moderate risk group. Consider hospital admission. 30-day mortality: 9 %.\n\n3 points, severe risk group. Urgent hospital admission. 30-day mortality: 15-40 %.\n\n4-5 points, highest risk group. Urgent hospital admission, consider ICU admission. 30-day mortality: 15-40 %\n\nCURB-65 score is fast to compute, requires likely already-available patient information, and provides an excellent risk stratification of community acquired pneumonia. It can facilitate better utilization of resources and treatment initiation especially in emergency care settings.","misuse":"The CURB-65 Score includes points for confusion and blood urea nitrogen, which in the acutely ill elderly patient, could be due to a variety of factors and therefore should be considered with caution while assigning scores. The score does not consider comorbid factors that may affect the mortality due to community-acquired pneumonia."}},"other_details":{"references":"Lim W, van der Eerden MM, Laing R, Boersma W, Karalus N, Town G, Lewis S, Macfarlane J.
