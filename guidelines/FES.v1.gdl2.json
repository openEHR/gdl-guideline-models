The FES is deemed a reliable and valid measure of fear of falling, with good test-retest reliability (Pearsonâ€™s correlation 0.71) with patients who reported avoiding activities because of fear of falling obtaining higher FES scores. On the 10-item FES self-report scale, the subject is invited to rate each of the activities on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being very confident and 10 being not confident at all, with respect to the confidence of performing said activities without falling. FES results range from 0 to 100, with scores greater than 70 indicating higher fear of falling (lowers self-efficacy and confidence) that impedes activities of daily living.\n\n"
