if successful, increase amounts to 5 mL, 10 mL, and finally 20 mL.\n   The last task involves drinking 50 mL of water as quickly as possible.\n\n--Solid Swallowing Trial:\n   Begin with a small piece of dry bread (1.5 x 1.5 cm).\n   The patient should chew and swallow within 10 seconds; if not, score for delayed swallowing.\n   Repeat this test five times, observing for aspiration signs after each swallow.\n\n--- If all tests are successful without aspiration signs, score accordingly.\n\nFinal Assessment:\nEvaluate based on deglutition, coughing, drooling, and voice change after each subtest.\nIf any aspiration signs occur during any part of the test, stop immediately and recommend further evaluation.\n\nBy following these guidelines systematically, clinicians can effectively assess swallowing ability and aspiration risk in patients using the GUSS.\n\n\n"},"gt0002":{"id":"gt0002","text":"openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.alert.v1"},"gt0006":{"id":"gt0006","text":"openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.roag.v1"},"gt0008":{"id":"gt0008","text":"openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.roag.v1"},"gt0009":{"id":"gt0009","text":"openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.guss.v0"},"gt0010":{"id":"gt0010","text":"Vigilance"},"gt0011":{"id":"gt0011","text":"Cough or Throat Clearing"},"gt0012":{"id":"gt0012","text":"Saliva Swallow"},"gt0013":{"id":"gt0013","text":"Drooling"},"gt0014":{"id":"gt0014","text":"Voice Change"},"gt0015":{"id":"gt0015","text":"openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.guss.v0"},"gt0017":{"id":"gt0017","text":"Guss Preliminary score","description":""},"gt0019":{"id":"gt0019","text":"openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.guss.v0"},"gt0020":{"id":"gt0020","text":"Preliminary Investigation Score"},"gt0021":{"id":"gt0021","text":"Set Assessment to Investigate further","description":""},"gt0022":{"id":"gt0022","text":"openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.health_risk.v1"},"gt0024":{"text":"Investigate further","id":"gt0024"},"gt0025":{"id":"gt0025","text":"Continue with Assessment","description":""},"gt0026":{"text":"Continue with Assessment","id":"gt0026"},"gt0027":{"id":"gt0027","text":"openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.health_risk.v1"},"gt0028":{"id":"gt0028","text":"openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.health_risk.v2"},"gt0029":{"id":"gt0029","text":"Risk assessment"}}}},"term_bindings":{}}}
