        "misuse" : "Not to be used for:\n- Staging or treatment planning of non-hepatocellular liver malignancies (e.g. cholangiocarcinoma or liver metastases).\n- Application of the original BCLC algorithm without adaptation to Swedish clinical practice.\n- Independent clinical decision-making without multidisciplinary evaluation.\n- Prognostic estimation without consideration of clinical factors not captured by the guideline.",
