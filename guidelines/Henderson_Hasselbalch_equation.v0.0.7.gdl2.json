It does not take into account the self-dissociation of water, which becomes increasingly important in dilute solutions. This assumption is not valid with pH values more than about 10. For such instances the mass-balance equation for hydrogen must be extended to take account of the self-ionization of water.\n\n2. The acid is monobasic and dissociates according to the equation: HA = H+ + A- where H+ stands for hydrated hydronium ion.\n\n3. The salt is completely dissociated in solution.\n\nA simple buffer solution consists of a solution of an acid and a salt of the conjugate base of the acid.\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is derived from the definition of the acid dissociation constant and relates the pH of a solution containing a mixture of the two components to the acid dissociation constant, Ka, and the concentrations of the two components.\n\npH = pKa + log10([A−] / [HA])\n\nWhere: pKa = - log10 (Ka)\n\nWhen the concentrations of the acid and the conjugate base are the same, i.e, when the acid is 50% dissociated, the pH of the solution is equal to the pKa of the acid.","misuse":"The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is an approximation, with a certain region of validity."}},"other_details":{"en":"Estimates the pH of a buffer solution when the Ka numerical value of the acid dissociation constant is known.","references":"Henderson LJ.
