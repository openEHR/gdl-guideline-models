For patients under 5 feet, one commonly-used modification is to subtract 2-5 lbs for each inch below 60 inches (written communication with leading expert Dr. Manjunath Pai, 2018).\n\nThis calculation is mainly used to calculate dosage for medications which are weight-based.","misuse":"There are multiple formulas to calculate ideal body weight, make sure if this formula is valid for your local population before using it.
