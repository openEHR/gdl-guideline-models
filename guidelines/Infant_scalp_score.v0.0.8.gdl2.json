It can also assist the clinician in determining whether cranial radiology (head X-ray or head CT) is necessary in the workup of intracranial injury. This score assists in determining the risk of intracranial injury based on patient age and hematoma characteristics. If the patient is found to be low risk, head imaging may not be necessary. ","misuse":"This tool was studied in patients who were asymptomatic and should be applied only to patients in that population.\n\nThis tool should not be used in patients who have any of the following:\n1. Loss of consciousness.\n\n2. Lethargy or irritability.\n\n3. Seizures.\n\n4. Three or more episodes of emesis.\n\n5. Mental status changes.\n\n6. Bulging fontanel.\n\n7. Signs of neurologic injury.\n\n8. Abnormal vital signs.\n\nIt should also not be used in infants who present with suspected nonaccidental trauma.\n\nPrimary outcomes differed in various validation studies, with one using skull fracture and another using the outcome of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI)."}},"other_details":{"en":"An assessment score used to evaluate risk of traumatic brain injury in infants with asymptomatic head injury.","references":"Greenes DS, Schutzman SA.
