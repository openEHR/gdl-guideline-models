It may be used in cardiac or noncardiac procedures.\n\nIt is useful in patients undergoing low risk procedures, or who are anticipated to require &lt;2 days admission. The score is an improvement on prior perioperative major cardiac event risk calculators for surgical patients by using datasets built on modern standards of care in cardiac event assessment (e.g. troponin vs. CK-based markers), in addition to stratifying risk based on type of planned procedure.\n\nFewer than 1% of patients experience major cardiac events during surgery, but 30-day mortality is high at 61%. Identifying high-risk patients for preoperative cardiac optimization is crucial for improving outcomes. The score is also useful in preoperative counseling and discussions of informed consent.\n\n","misuse":"The score tends to underestimate cardiac events in patients with elevated risk.\n\nPulmonary edema and complete heart block, outcomes for previous perioperative cardiac risk calculators, were not part of the NSQIP database from which this calculator was derived."}},"other_details":{"en":"Predicts risk of myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac arrest after surgery."},"other_contributors":[]},"definition":{"data_bindings":{"gt0002":{"id":"gt0002","type":"INPUT","model_id":"openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.basic_demographic.v1","template_id":"openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.basic_demographic.v1","elements":{"gt0003":{"id":"gt0003","path":"/data[at0001]/events[at0002]/data[at0003]/items[at0013]"}}},"gt0004":{"id":"gt0004","type":"INPUT","model_id":"openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.asa_physical_status.v0","template_id":"openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.asa_physical_status.v0","elements":{"gt0005":{"id":"gt0005","path":"/data[at0001]/events[at0002]/data[at0003]/items[at0004]"}}}},"templates":{},"rules":{}},"ontology":{"term_definitions":{"en":{"id":"en","terms":{"gt0001":{"id":"gt0001","text":"MICA score","description":"An assessment score used to predict risk of myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac arrest after surgery."},"gt0002":{"id":"gt0002","text":"openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.basic_demographic.v1"},"gt0003":{"id":"gt0003","text":"Age"},"gt0004":{"id":"gt0004","text":"openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.asa_physical_status.v0"},"gt0005":{"id":"gt0005","text":"Description"}}}},"term_bindings":{}}}
