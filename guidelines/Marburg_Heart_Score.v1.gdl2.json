        "misuse": "Not to be used in an emergency setting.\n\nInterchest should not be used in patients with a readily apparent cause of chest pain (e.g. trauma, infection), clear anginal equivalent symptoms (e.g. jaw pain, dyspnea on exertion, arm pain), or if other testing (e.g. electrocardiography, lab testing) has suggested a clearly cardiac etiology.\n\nNot to be used for a positive diagnosis of angina or CAD, but as a negative tool to help assess who is low-enough risk to not need further evaluation.\n\nWhile scores ≤2 make unstable CAD highly unlikely (NPV 98%), scores ≥3 are only modestly predictive of CAD (PPV 28%).\n\nMost applicable to patients 35 years or older."
