        "use": "The mRS is a widely used measure to assess the functional outcomes for patients who have suffered a stroke. It can also provide a common language for describing the degree of disability.\n\n",
        "misuse": "The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) assesses disability in patients who have suffered a stroke and is compared over time to check for recovery and degree of continued disability. A score of 0 is no disability, 5 is disability requiring constant care for all needs; 6 is death.\n\nThe mRS has been used in clinical research for over 30 years and is a common standard for assessing functional outcomes in patients with stroke.\nMultiple studies have shown that the mRS correlates with physiological indicators such as stroke type, lesion size and neurological impairment as assessed by other stroke evaluation scales.\nPoints to keep in mind:\n\nThere is criticism that the mRS contains subject components that results in variability and bias that lowers the score’s reliability.\nThe use of structured interviews when assessing the mRS appears to result in improved interrater reliability though this effect is not completely consistent.",
