Each parameter is assigned a score, and the total score is calculated. Higher scores indicate more severe illness and a greater need for clinical intervention.\nInterpretation: The total score helps identify the level of monitoring and interventions required. A higher NEWS2 score typically necessitates urgent medical attention.\nNEWS2 scoring thresholds:\n0-4: Low risk\n5-6: Medium risk\n7 or above: High risk","misuse":"Not to be used for diagnosing specific conditions. The NEWS2 score is a monitoring tool, not a diagnostic tool, and should not replace clinical judgment.\nNot applicable to pediatric patients. NEWS2 is specifically designed for adults and is not appropriate for use in children or neonates.\nNot to be used as a standalone tool. It should be used in conjunction with clinical assessment and judgment."}},"other_details":{"references":"Royal College of Physicians. National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2.
