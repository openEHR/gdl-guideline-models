Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).\n\nClass II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).\n\nClass III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea\n\nClass IV: Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.\n\n\nClasses of Objective Assessment are:\n\nClass A: No objective evidence of cardiovascular disease. No symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity.\n\nClass B: Objective evidence of minimal cardiovascular disease. Mild symptoms and slight limitation during ordinary activity. Comfortable at rest.\n\nClass C: Objective evidence of moderately severe cardiovascular disease. Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity. Comfortable only at rest.\n\nClass D: Objective evidence of severe cardiovascular disease. Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest.",
