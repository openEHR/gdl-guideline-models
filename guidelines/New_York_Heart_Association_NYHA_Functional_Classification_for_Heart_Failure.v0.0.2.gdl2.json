This classification helps guide treatment plans, monitor disease progression, and evaluate treatment outcomes.", "use": "Pre-conditions: Used in patients diagnosed with heart failure to evaluate their functional status and severity of symptoms. It is applicable to both chronic and acute heart failure cases.\nUsage: The NYHA classification is performed by evaluating the patient's reported symptoms and exercise tolerance. The classification is divided into four classes:\n\nClass I: No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms.\n\nClass II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitations, or shortness of breath.\n\nClass III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary physical activity causes symptoms.\n\nClass IV: Inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms may be present even at rest.\n\nInterpretation: The classification helps physicians determine the severity of the patient's heart failure and tailor interventions accordingly.", "misuse": "Not to be used for assessment of non-cardiac conditions. The NYHA classification is specific to heart failure and should not be applied to assess other cardiovascular diseases or non-cardiac conditions.\nNot to be used as a diagnostic tool. It is used for functional classification and symptom assessment in known heart failure patients, not for diagnosing heart failure itself."}}, "other_details": {"references": "Stamp KD, Prasun MA, McCoy TP, Rathman L.
