The classification depends on the severity grade of the user input.\n\nGustilo classification accounts for mainly three factors in stratifying the injury severity:\nAmount of energy in the injury mechanism, the extent of soft tissue injury and the extent of contamination.\n\nProgression from the least severe stages (I and II) to the most severe ones (IIIA, IIIB and IIIC) occurs when all the three factors are severe and there is bone damage and/ or vascular injury.",
