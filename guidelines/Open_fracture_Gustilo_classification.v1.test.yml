  expected_output:
    1:
      gt0017|Grade III: High energy mechanism, extensive soft tissue damage. Over 10 cm in length. Vascular repair and/or have been open for 8 hours prior to treatment. Very high degree of contamination. Antibiotic treatment recommendation includes 1st generation cephalosporin, aminoglycoside treatment (usually gentamicine) and preventive PCN in high risk of contamination injuries such as farm ones.

  expected_output:
    1:
      gt0018|Grade III injury subdivisions: IIIA adequate periosteal coverage of the fractured bone although extensive soft tissue damage is present. IIIB inadequate periosteal cover with bone damage and soft tissue damage. Also associated with massive contamination. Requires soft tissue flap repairing of the injury. IIIC associates with arterial injury and extensive soft tissue laceration and often requires repairing vascular and skeletal fixation procedures.
