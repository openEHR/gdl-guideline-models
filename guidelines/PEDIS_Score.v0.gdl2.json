Based on this total score, the risk for adverse outcome (a non-healing ulcer, need for amputation or death at 6 months) is determined.\n\nThe scoring system:\n\nPerfusion was determined by a combination of clinical examination of dorsal pedal or posterior tibial artery of the affected foot and noninvasive vascular studies. The grading was done as follows,\n\nNo peripheral arterial disease                                           0\n\nPeripheral arterial disease, no critical limb ischemia      1\n\nCritical limb ischemia                                                       2\n\nExtent Extent was estimated by multiplying the largest diameter by the second largest diameter measured perpendicular to the first diameter and expressed as cm2 .\n\nSkin intact            0\n\n< 1 cm2                 1\n\n1 – 3 cm2              2\n\n>3 cm2                  3\n\nDepth was evaluated using a sterile blunt nasal probe and imaging tests.\n\nSkin intact                      0\n\nSuperficial                      1\n\nFascia, muscle, tendon  2\n\nBone or joint                  3                           \n\nInfection was based principally on the presence or absence of symptoms and signs of inflammation, and the presence of secretion, the results of laboratory tests and imaging tests.\n\nNone                                                                   0\n\nSurface                                                               1\n\nAbscess, fasciitis, and/or septic arthritis           2\n\nSystemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome    3\n\nSensation was evaluated with a 10-g monofilament and/or a 128-Hz tuning fork sensation on one or more sites of the foot\n\nSensation intact               0\n\nLoss of sensation             1\n\nThe total score ranges from 0 – 12.
