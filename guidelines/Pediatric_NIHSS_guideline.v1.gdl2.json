        "use": "Can be used in pediatric patients 2-18 years old with clinical and radiologic signs of acute ischemic stroke.\nInstruction: Administer the questions in the order below. In order to improve score accuracy, emphasize with family members the need to refrain from hinting at the correct responses to questions asked.\nVariables: \n\n1A. Level of consciousness: Alert; keenly responsive=0, Not alert but arousable by minor stimulation to obey, answer, or respond=1, Not alert, requires repeated stimulation, or is obtunded and requires strong/painful stimulation to make movements (not stereotyped)=2, Responds only with reflex motor or autonomic effects or totally unresponsive, flaccid, areflexic=3\n\n1B. Ask age and to point out family member (Ask the child “how old are you?”, give credit if child states correct age or shows correct number of fingers for age; ask the child “where is X?” (X = parent or other familiar family member present), give credit if child correctly points/gazes purposefully in the direction of the family member): Answers both questions correctly=0,  Answers one question correctly=1, Answers neither question correctly=2\n\n1C. Command to blink eyes and touch nose: Performs both tasks correctly =0, Performs one task correctly=1, Performs neither task correctly=2\n\n2. Horizontal extraocular movements (Only assess horizontal gaze): Normal=0, Partial gaze palsy (abnormal gaze in one or both eyes but no forced deviation or total gaze paresis)=1, Forced deviation or total gaze paresis not overcome by oculocephalic maneuver=2\n\n3. Visual fields (Use finger counting (if >6 years old) or visual threat (if 2-6 years old) as appropriate): No visual loss =0, Partial hemianopia=1, Complete hemianopia=2, Bilateral hemianopia (blind including cortical blindness) =3\n\n4. Facial palsy: Normal symmetrical movement=0, Minor paralysis (flattened nasolabial fold, asymmetry on smiling)=1, Partial paralysis (total or near total paralysis of lower face)=2, Complete paralysis of one or both sides (absence of facial movement in the upper and lower face) =3\n\n\n5A. Left arm motor drift (Drift is scored if the arm falls before 10 sec; for children too young to follow precise directions or uncooperative, grade power by observation of spontaneous or elicited movement): No drift, limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees for full 10 seconds=0, Drift, limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees, but drifts down before full 10 seconds; does not hit bed or other support=1, Some effort against gravity, limb cannot get to or maintain (if cued) 90 (or 45) degrees, drifts down to bed, but has some effort against gravity=2, No effort against gravity, limb falls=3, No movement=4, Amputation, joint fusion =9\n\n5B. Right arm motor drift (Drift is scored if the arm falls before 10 sec; for children too young to follow precise directions or uncooperative, grade power by observation of spontaneous or elicited movement): No drift, limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees for full 10 seconds=0, Drift, limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees, but drifts down before full 10 seconds; does not hit bed or other support=1, Some effort against gravity, limb cannot get to or maintain (if cued) 90 (or 45) degrees, drifts down to bed, but has some effort against gravity=2, No effort against gravity, limb falls=3, No movement=4, Amputation, joint fusion =9\n\n6A. Left leg motor drift (6A. Left leg motor drift):No drift, leg holds 30 degrees position for full 5 seconds=0, Drift, leg falls by the end of the 5 second period but does not hit bed=1, Leg falls to bed by 5 seconds, but has some effort against gravity=2, No effort against gravity, leg falls to bed immediately=3, No movement=4,  Amputation, joint fusion =9\n\n6B. Right leg motor drift (Drift is scored if the the leg falls before 5 sec; for children too young to follow precise directions or uncooperative, power in each limb should be graded by observation of spontaneous or elicited movement): No drift, leg holds 30 degrees position for full 5 seconds=0, Drift, leg falls by the end of the 5 second period but does not hit bed=1, Leg falls to bed by 5 seconds, but has some effort against gravity=2, No effort against gravity, leg falls to bed immediately=3, No movement=4, Amputation, joint fusion=9\n\n7. Limb ataxia (Ask child to reach for a toy, or ask child to kick a toy or the examiner’s hand in children <5 years or otherwise uncooperative for the standard exam): Absent= 0, Present in one limb= 1, Present in two limbs =2\n\n8: Sensation (Pin-prick test; for children too young or otherwise uncooperative for reporting gradations of sensory loss, observe for any behavioral response to pin prick): Normal; no sensory loss=0, Mild to moderate sensory loss; patient feels pinprick is less sharp or dull on the affected side, or there is a loss of superficial pain with pinprick but patient is aware he/she is being touched=1, Severe to total sensory loss; patient is not aware of being touched in the face, arm, and leg=2\n\n9. Best language (If age ≥6 years with normal language development before onset of stroke, ask child to describe picture, to name items, repeat words, read sentences; for children age 2-6 years, score item based on observations of language comprehension and speech during the examination): No aphasia, normal=0, Mild to moderate aphasia=1, Severe aphasia=2, Mute, global aphasia; no usable speech or auditory comprehension=3\n\n10. Dysarthria (Ask patient to read or repeat words): Normal=0, Mild to moderate; patient slurs at least some words and, at worst, can be understood with some difficulty=1, Severe; patient's speech is so slurred as to be unintelligible in the absence of or out of proportion to any dysphasia, or is mute/anarthric=2, Intubated or other physical barrier=9\n\n11. Extinction and inattention: No abnormality=0, Visual, tactile, auditory, spatial, or personal inattention or extinction to bilateral simultaneous stimulation in one of the sensory modalities= 1, Profound hemi-inattention or hemi-inattention to >1 modality; does not recognize own hand or orients to only one side of space=2\n\nFormula: Addition of the selected variables. \nInterpretation: Higher scores correspond with worse prognosis.\n",
