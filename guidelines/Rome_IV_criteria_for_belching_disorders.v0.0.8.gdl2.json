Therefore, this criteria should not be the only method guiding the diagnosis and management of patients, a thorough clinical examination and physical assessment should be performed to arrive at a final diagnosis.

Patients presenting with recurrent upper gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of a belching disorder for at least the past 6 months should be diagnosed using this criteria."}},"other_details":{"references":"Stanghellini V, Chan FK, Hasler WL, et al.
