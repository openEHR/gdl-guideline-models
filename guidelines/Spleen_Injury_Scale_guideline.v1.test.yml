    1:
      gt0008|Comment: According to the AAST norms for splenic injury grading, Grade I characterized by subcapsular haematoma less than 10% of surface area and capsular laceration less than 1 cm depth.
      gt0006|General tip: As splenic trauma injuries are common and can pose a lethal threat, the focus is put on the quick diagnosis, conservation treatment and in some required cases splenectomy.
