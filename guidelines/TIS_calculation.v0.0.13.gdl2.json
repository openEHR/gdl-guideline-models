Each of these 3 areas are evaluated based on certain components. The total score ranges from 0-23. Healthy individuals should achieve a perfect score of 23. The scores for the 3 areas range as follows:\n\nStatic balance: 0 - 7; evaluated with 3 components\n\nDynamic balance: 0 - 10; evaluated with 10 components\n\nCoordination: 0 - 6; evaluated with 4 components\n\nThe Trunk Impairment Scale has been shown to exhibit sufficient reliability, internal consistency and validity for use in clinical practice and research. It is mainly used to assess and quantify the trunk stability and mobility in patients who may have certain neurological deficits.","misuse":"The TIS score mainly evaluates the sitting balance and coordination of patients.
