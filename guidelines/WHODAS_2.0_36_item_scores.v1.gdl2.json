Frågorna ställs med hänsyn till de senaste 30 dagarna. Används för att utreda vilka svårigheter en patient upplever till följd av fysiskt eller psykiskt sjukdomstillstånd. Dessa tillstånd kan inkludera somatisk sjukdom, psykisk sjukdom och missbruk av olika slag.\n\nEn kort version av formuläret finns tillgänglig och består av 12 frågor vilka förklarar 81% av variansen i den fullständiga versionen. Denna kan med fördel användas för screening.\n\nDet finns även en hybridversion, den sk 12-24-versionen. Denna kan ej självadministreras. \n\nPoängen baseras på svarsalternativen enligt:\n\n0 = Inga svårigheter\n1 = Lite svårigheter\n2 = Måttliga svårigheter\n3 = Stora svårigheter\n4 = Extrema svårigheter/kan inte\n\nResultatet för det fullständiga formuläret bearbetas på två sätt: Enkel (summan av samtliga frågor angiven som procent), och Komplex (baserad på IRT - Item Response Theory, med viktning av resultatet). För vidare detaljer, vänligen besök WHO:s officiella hemsida.\n\nTolkning av resultat bör göras med beaktande av domänspecifika resultat för att kunna identifiera områden som av patienten upplevs som särskilt problematiska. Som tillägg finns tre övergripande frågor för att kartlägga frekvens och påverkan på dagliga livet under senaste 30 dagarna.",

        "use": "The 36 item full version WHODAS 2.0 questionnaire can be used by way of a self-report, proxy-form or interview-lead process and is used to enquire about difficulties a patient may experience due to health/mental health issues over a 30 day period. \nThe health issues can include a variety of illnesses, diseases, drug and alcohol and mental/emotional problems of acute or chronic in nature.\n\nThere is a 12-item short version contains 81% of the variance of the full version and can be used as a way to screen for further investigation due to receiving positive responses during the 12-item version - starting with completing the subsequent 24 items to make up the full 36 version. However, the 12-24 version can not be completed via a self-reported method as the results must be calculated in between the 12 and 24 items.\n\nThe scoring for each item ranges from 0 to 4 related to the following:\n\n0 = No Difficulty\n1 = Mild Difficulty\n2 = Moderate Difficulty\n3 = Severe Difficulty\n4 = Extreme Difficulty or Cannot Do\n\nThere are 2 scoring systems for the 36-item version: Simple (aggregate count of all the questions as a percentage) and Complex (based on IRT - \\\"item response theory\\\" which uses a form of weighting based on the severity of the item in question- again represented as a percentage). More details on this complex scoring can be found on the WHO website. In addition complex score for the 6 domains can also be derived.\n\nScore interpretation should follow the domain-specific scores to indicate those aspects of the patient's symptoms and issues that are most problematic and can be classified alongside the 0-4 scale as shown above to relate to the level of difficulty experienced. In addition to the scored questions, there are 3 general questions which relate to the number of days with a 30 day period that the patient experienced the difficulties and whether the reduced or totally stopped them living a normal life, which can be used to elaborate for each item that is positively scored.",
        "misuse": "The WHODAS 2.0 questionnaire results should not be used in isolation of further assessment or to be used solely for the purposes of making a diagnosis without supporting evidence. If the score is high, the patient should be referred to an appropriate counsellor/practitioner.\n\nThe WHO recommends interviewer users to read through their user manual before taking the patient through questionnaire.",
