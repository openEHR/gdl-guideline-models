Chest wall retractions: None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, Severe=3\n2. Stridor: None=0, With agitation=1, At rest=2\n3. Cyanosis: None=0, With agitation=4, At rest=5\n4. Level of consciousness: Normal=0, Disoriented=5\n5. Air entry: Normal=0, Decreased=1, Markedly decreased=2\n\nWestley Croup Score formula: \n5 items using a Likert-type scale with zero representing the normal state. Points assigned as above.\n\nWestley Croup Score and Level of Severity: \nscore 0-2= Mild\nscore 3-5= Moderate\nscore 6-11= Severe\nscore 12-17= Impending Respiratory Failure\n\nNote: Remember that the Westley Croup Score is typically used for research purposes; management is typically based on clinical signs and symptoms: (1) Consider bacterial tracheitis in an ill-appearing child with croup-like symptoms. (2) The vast majority (>80%) of children presenting to the ED with croup have mild disease; severe croup is rare (<1%).\n",
