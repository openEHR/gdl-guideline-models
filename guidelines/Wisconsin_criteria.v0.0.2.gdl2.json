It is used when assessing patients with facial injuries from trauma in the emergency department. By using this, we can minimize exposure to radiation and costs by avoiding unnecessary maxillofacial CT imaging in cases with a low likelihood of significant injury.\n\nThe Wisconsin Criteria is positive if any of the following findings are present: \n\nBony stepoff or instability.\n\nPeriorbital swelling or contusion.\n\nGlasgow Coma Scale score &lt;14.\n\nMalocclusion.\n\nTooth absence.","misuse":"This tool does not diagnose facial fractures; rather, it assists in determining the necessity of additional imaging.\n\nSince these criteria are based on physical examination findings, results depend on the accuracy of a clinician’s physical examination skills.\n\nThe original study population consisted primarily of blunt trauma patients at a single trauma center, which may limit the utility in penetrating trauma cases and affect generalizability.\n\nIn the original study, the presence of any of the 5 criteria was 98.2% sensitive for the presence of a facial fracture, with a negative predictive value of 87.8% in the absence of all 5 criteria.\n\nValidation studies show a sensitivity range of 73%-90% and a negative predictive value of 60%-93%."}},"other_details":{"en":"A criteria used to predict need for CT use after maxillofacial injury.","references":"Sitzman TJ, Hanson SE, Alsheik NH, Gentry LR, Doyle JF, Gutowski KA.
