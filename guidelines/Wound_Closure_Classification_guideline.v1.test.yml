- id: Primary
  input:
    1:
      gt0003|Wound Features: local::at0005|Clean wound with minimal tissue loss, e.g. surgical wounds, clean lacerations.|
  expected_output:
    1:
      gt0006|Management: local::at0013|Perform closure within 6-8 hours of trauma. If well-vascularized, may be closed up to 24 hours after trauma.|
      gt0005|Wound Closure Classification: local::at0009|Primary|
- id: Secondary
  input:
    1:
      gt0003|Wound Features: local::at0006|Significant tissue loss precluding tension-free approximation of edges, devitalized edges, ulcerations, or abscess cavities.|
  expected_output:
    1:
      gt0006|Management: local::at0014|No surgical closure. Daily dressing changes. Consider negative pressure vacuum therapy.|
      gt0005|Wound Closure Classification: local::at0010|Secondary|
- id: Tertiary 
  input:
    1:
      gt0003|Wound Features: local::at0007|Grossly contaminated wounds with or without significant tissue loss, e.g. contaminated by soil or feces, animal bites, projectiles.|
  expected_output:
    1:
      gt0006|Management: local::at0015|Thoroughly explore, irrigate, and debride. Observe for 3-7 days before surgical closure or skin grafting. May benefit from negative pressure vacuum therapy.|
      gt0005|Wound Closure Classification: local::at0011|Tertiary (Delayed Primary)|
