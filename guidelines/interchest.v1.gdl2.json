There are contradicting opinions, which is considered better, studies show similar NPVs for both guidelines, but MHS is better studied (see [5] for reference).\n",
        "misuse": "Not to be used in an emergency setting.\n\nInterchest should not be used in patients with a readily apparent cause of chest pain (e.g. trauma, infection), clear anginal equivalent symptoms (e.g. jaw pain, dyspnea on exertion, arm pain), or if other testing (e.g. electrocardiography, lab testing) has suggested a clearly cardiac etiology.\n\nNot to be used for a positive diagnosis of angina or CAD, but as a negative tool to help assess who is low-enough risk to not need further evaluation.\n\nWhile scores ≤1 make unstable CAD highly unlikely (NPV 98%), scores ≥2 are only modestly predictive of CAD (PPV 43%).\n\nMost applicable to patients 30 years or older.\n"
