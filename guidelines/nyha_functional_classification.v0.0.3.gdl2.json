This classification helps guide treatment plans, monitor disease progression, and evaluate treatment outcomes.","use":"Used in patients diagnosed with heart failure to evaluate their functional status and severity of symptoms. It is applicable to both chronic and acute heart failure cases.\nUsage: The NYHA classification is performed by evaluating the patient's reported symptoms and exercise tolerance. The classification is divided into four classes:\n\nClass I: No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms.\n\nClass II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitations, or shortness of breath.\n\nClass III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary physical activity causes symptoms.\n\nClass IV: Inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms may be present even at rest.\n\nThe classification helps physicians determine the severity of the patient's heart failure and tailor interventions accordingly.","misuse":"Not to be used as a heart failure diagnostic tool or for assessmnet of non-cardiac conditiions."}},"other_details":{"references":"Stamp KD, Prasun MA, McCoy TP, Rathman L.
