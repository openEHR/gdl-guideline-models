      gt0013|Total Score: 1
      gt0022|Recommendation: Prior to initial trach change EOB/ OOB mobility is clinically indicated. Patient initial transfer require direct rehabilitative assessment upon mobility recommendation.

      gt0013|Total Score: 7
      gt0022|Recommendation: Meeting with primary team and Otolaryngology deemed necessary for reassessing mobility indication. Patient, under clinical pathway may prescribed with therapeutic activities in bed, transfer to chair position and or sitting up on the bed. Presence of respiratory therapist required for EOB/ OOB mobility. Medical doctor presence requested based on treating therapist discretion.
