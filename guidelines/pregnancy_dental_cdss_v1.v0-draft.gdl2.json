        "purpose": "To provide clinical decision support for safe dental treatment of pregnant patients. The guideline helps clinicians decide when to perform or defer dental procedures based on trimester, assess radiograph safety, evaluate vital signs, and recommend safe local anaesthetic use. It also ensures avoidance of medications and anaesthetic agents from unsafe FDA pregnancy categories (C, D, X), supporting maternal and fetal safety.\n",
        "use": "This guideline is intended for use in dental and oral health settings when treating pregnant patients. It supports clinicians by providing trimester-specific recommendations, reminding about safe positioning in late pregnancy, and guiding the selection and dosage of local anaesthetic agents. It should be used as an aid to clinical decision-making, not as a substitute for professional judgment.\n",
        "misuse": "This guideline is not intended for non-pregnant patients or for use outside of dental care. It must not be used as the sole source for prescribing systemic medications in pregnancy. It should not replace consultation with obstetric care providers in high-risk pregnancies or in cases of medical complications.\n"
