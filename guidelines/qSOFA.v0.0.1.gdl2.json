It is can be used bedside to assess the risk of poor outcome in patients with suspected or confirmed infection outside the ICU. qSOFA consists of three criteria: altered mental state (GCS&lt;15), fast respiratory rate (≥22 breaths per min), and low blood pressure (SBP≤100 mmHg). Each criteria is worth one point, thus the maximum qSOFA Score is 3. The qSOFA protocol is a markedly simplified version of the SOFA protocol. qSOFA uses only its three clinical criteria and uses \\\"altered mental status\\\" instead of GCS≤13. A qSOFA score of ≥2 is indicative of a high risk of poor prognosis (mortality or ICU stay of ≥3 days). Patients with qSOFA score of ≥2 should be assessed for organ dysfunction (this includes lactate levels). Furthermore, the SOFA Score should be calculated for these patients and the standard interventions for sepsis should be used as treatment. A qSOFA score of &lt;2 is not associated with a high risk of poor prognosis, but it does not suggest that the subject of care is not a high risk patient. If sepsis is still suspected when the qSOFA score is &lt;2, continue monitoration and evaluation of the patient. Initiate standard treatment if needed. Serial qSOFA assessments can be performed to detect changes in prognosis.","misuse":"Do not use to rule out sepsis.

Conduct qSOFA assessments regularly in order to detect changes in prognosis.","copyright":"© Cambio CDS","keywords":["infection","icu","mental state","respiratory rate","sepsis","hypotension","qsofa"]}},"other_details":{"references":"Seymour CW, Liu VX, Iwashyna TJ, Brunkhorst FM, Rea TD, Scherag A, Rubenfeld G, Kahn JM, Shankar-Hari M, Singer M, Deutschman CS, Escobar GJ, Angus DC.
